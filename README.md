# Fibonacci Comparison

Shows the speed and limits of different algorithms as well as languages.

Talking points:
Recursion Limit
"Brute" vs Intentional Optimisation using languages / language filters vs smart algorithm choices / custom caching
Result stability (margin of error, small datasets (-> recursion limits, re-running multiple times, unexpected automated optimisations), environmental factors)
